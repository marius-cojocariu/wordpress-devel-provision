wordpress-devel-provision
=========================

Simple script to fully automate different wordpress versions devel deployments

This is a working draft, not finished yet.

The basic idea is, that you create a magnificent plugin in the src directory and then you would want to test it on various versions of wordpress. The ```build-playground``` will create different directories for each wordpress version you want to test and it will deploy there a fully working vagrant environment.

The plugin files will be symlinked to each wordpress directory.

More info to be added when it will be complete.
